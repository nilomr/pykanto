# Working with paths and directories


`pykanto` provides a convenient way to store all paths pointing to directories
and files in your project together: this makes it easier to access them, and
promotes standardisation among your projects.


```{code-block} python
---
caption: First, import any dependencies
---

from pathlib import Path
from pykanto.utils.paths import link_project_data, ProjDirs

```

#### 1. Link your data

Find your project's root directory. You can do this in any number of ways, as
long as you do it programmatically. For example, the code below assumes that you
are doing version control with [git](https://git-scm.com/) and simply gets the root of your repository:

```{code-block} python
:linenos:

PROJECT_ROOT = Path(
git.Repo('.', search_parent_directories=True).working_tree_dir)

```

It is common to have your raw data on a large external drive or remote server
(for example I use a RAID system). If this is the case for you, you probably
want to link the actual location of your raw data to an otherwise empty `/data`
folder in your project for ease of access and clarity. Pykanto includes a
function to do just that:

```{code-block} python
:linenos:

DATA_LOCATION = Path('path/to/your/data/drive')
link_project_data(DATA_LOCATION, PROJECT_ROOT / 'data')

```

```{admonition} Tip:
:class: tip

You wil likely create different derived datasets from the same raw data, and that is why pykanto lets your (raw) data live wherever you want.
I **strongly** recommend that you make its directory read-only and
never ever touch it.
```

#### 2. Set up the project directories

Next, tell `pykanto` where the raw data for your project live, 

```{code-block} python
:linenos:

RAW_DATA = PROJECT_ROOT / 'data' / 'raw' / 'BIGBIRD_2021'
```

and build the project's directory tree. See the [`ProjDirs`](../_autosummary/pykanto.utils.paths.html#pykanto.utils.paths.ProjDirs) docs for more information.


```{code-block} python
:linenos:

DIRS = ProjDirs(PROJECT_ROOT, RAW_DATA, mkdir=True)
print(DIRS)

```


If you need to change the location of your raw data before you create a dataset,
you can use the following method:


```{code-block} python
:linenos:

DIRS.update_json_locs(PROJECT)

```
You can safely try this even if you haven't moved your data at all; you will
just get a message ``Files exist: no need to update paths. You can force update
by setting `overwrite_dataset = True`.``.


If you need to change the location of your dataset,

```{code-block} python
:linenos:
```
