Vocalisation analysis
=====================


Pykanto is designed to provide a platform that enables researchers to run and
store any analyses they might need with ease and in a reproducible way. The
precise nature of these analyses will vary greatly, so pykanto's aim is not to
provide functions or methods to, for example, extract audio featuresâ€”there already are
other, much better libraries for that.

These are some examples that show one way in which you can extract and store
features from vocalisations in a dataset created with pykanto:



.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

centroid, bandwidth = spec_centroid_bandwidth(dataset, key=key, plot=True)
minfreqs, maxfreqs = approximate_minmax_frequency(dataset, key=key, plot=True)



# Add output
